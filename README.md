Notes during Lab1:
In general, this lab focuses on how to run machine learning / deep learning algorithm in a serverless ML system. 
It is something very important in this new era. 
Due to the tremendous computation power which a lot of giant companies(Nvidia, AMD, Google, Amazon...) have provided, 
nowadays we just need to pay very little money to train our model with huge data under ultra high speed.

First, we get the feature from feature store Hopsworks.

In this lab, we didn't use GitHub Actions because of the version of my machine(Macbook M1, Arm 64 structure).
Instead, we used Modal as the cloud to run our code.
